# Metropolia Attendance App Frontend

Welcome to the TypeDoc documentation for the Metropolia Attendance App frontend. This application is a convenient solution for teachers and students to take attendance during classes. It's designed to streamline the attendance process, making it easier for teachers to keep track of student attendance and for students to check in to their classes.

## Key Features
- **Easy Check-In:** Students can quickly check in to their classes with just a few taps.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can easily see who's in class and who's not.

## Architecture

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, with a modular architecture that ensures maintainability and scalability. The application is structured into various components, views, and assets, each serving a specific purpose.

### Components
The frontend is built with modular components, each serving a specific function in the user interface. These components contribute to a cohesive and responsive design, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience for both teachers and students.

### Views
Views define the different pages and screens within the application. Each view is tailored to provide a distinct functionality, whether it's the student check-in screen or the teacher's attendance dashboard.

### Assets
The frontend includes a collection of assets, such as fonts and images, that contribute to the overall visual appeal of the application. These assets are carefully selected to enhance the user experience.

### Tailwind Config
Tailwind CSS is utilized to style and design the frontend. The Tailwind config file defines the customization and configuration settings for the CSS framework, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing layout.

## Setup

To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. **Run the application**: Start the frontend development server by running `npm run dev` in the `frontend` directory.

## Directory Structure

The frontend directory is organized as follows:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **assets**: Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
  - **components**: Contains reusable UI components.
  - **contexts**: Contains context providers for managing global state.
  - **hooks**: Contains custom hooks for reusable logic.
  - **routes**: Contains route components for defining the application's navigation.
  - **utils**: Contains utility functions and helpers.
  - **views**: Contains view components that define the different pages and screens of the application.
- **public**: Contains public assets and the main HTML file.

Navigate through the documentation to understand the structure and functionality of the frontend codebase. Each module, class, interface, type, and function is documented in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the code.

Happy coding and attendance tracking!
